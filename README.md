# Directory-Recursive learning File Copy/ranaming tool

This script iterates through a directory and all of its subdirectories recursively, renaming files
and copying files with new names as specified by the user. We needed this at three birds with
a large directory relating to assessments, where a couple thousand screenshots needed
to be renamed to a very specific name standard.
